# ReelNet Architecture Documentation

## 1. Architecture Overview

Based on the requirements of ReelNet - a comprehensive English learning platform with complex features and AI integration, we propose a **Modular Monolith** architecture for the initial phase, with a roadmap for transitioning to Microservices as the system evolves.

### 1.1 Rationale for Modular Monolith

- **Faster initial development**: Quick MVP deployment with less operational complexity
- **Lower operational costs**: Easier to deploy, monitor, and maintain in the early stages
- **Reduced network communication complexity**: Modules communicate within a single application
- **Easier refactoring**: Ability to restructure code without affecting external APIs
- **Simplified debugging**: The entire application can be debugged in a single environment
- **Clear transition path**: Modular Monolith provides a clear roadmap to Microservices

### 2.1 Overall Structure

The architecture is divided into distinct modules but deployed as a single application:

```
reelnet/
├── frontend/                     # React frontend application
│   ├── public/
│   └── src/
│       ├── common/               # Shared components
│       ├── modules/              # Feature-based modules
│       │   ├── reading/
│       │   ├── listening/
│       │   ├── speaking/
│       │   ├── writing/
│       │   ├── vocabulary/
│       │   ├── exam-prep/
│       │   └── community/
│       └── core/                 # Core services
├── backend/
│   ├── src/main/java/com/reelnet/
│   │   ├── application/          # Application services
│   │   ├── domain/               # Domain models and logic
│   │   │   ├── reading/
│   │   │   ├── listening/
│   │   │   ├── speaking/
│   │   │   ├── writing/
│   │   │   ├── vocabulary/
│   │   │   ├── exam/
│   │   │   ├── community/
│   │   │   └── user/
│   │   ├── infrastructure/       # Infrastructure concerns
│   │   │   ├── persistence/
│   │   │   ├── security/
│   │   │   ├── messaging/
│   │   │   └── integration/
│   │   ├── interfaces/           # API endpoints
│   │   │   ├── rest/
│   │   │   └── websocket/
│   │   └── ReelNetApplication.java
│   └── src/test/
└── shared-libraries/             # Shared code between modules
```

### 2.2 Module Separation

Each module represents a bounded context in the system and has the following structure:

```
module/
├── api/                 # Public API of the module (interfaces, DTOs)
├── internal/            # Implementation details
├── domain/              # Domain model and business logic
└── infrastructure/      # Infrastructure details specific to module
```

## 3. Architectural Layers

### 3.1 Presentation Layer (Frontend)

- **Technology**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Structure**: Module-based organization with shared components
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Display user interface
    - Handle user interactions
    - Manage UI state
    - Communicate with Backend APIs

### 3.2 Application Layer (Backend)

- **Technology**: Spring Boot (Java)
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Orchestrate business flows
    - Handle requests and responses
    - Transaction management
    - Delegate processing to Domain Layer
    - Integrate with external services

### 3.3 Domain Layer

- **Responsibilities**:
    - Contains core business logic
    - Defines entities, value objects, and domain services
    - Enforces business rules
    - Independent of infrastructure

### 3.4 Infrastructure Layer

- **Responsibilities**:
    - Database interactions
    - Integration with external services (AI Services, Email, SMS)
    - Security implementation
    - Caching, logging, monitoring

## 4. Module Integration

### 4.1 Synchronous Communication

- **Domain Events**: Use domain events for communication between modules
- **Module APIs**: Each module provides a clear public API for other modules
- **Dependency Injection**: Use DI to integrate dependencies between modules

### 4.2 Asynchronous Communication

- **Event Bus**: Use in-memory event bus for communication between modules
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ/Kafka for background tasks and integrations

## 5. Data Management

### 5.1 Database Design

- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (shared database with schema separation)
- **Schema per Module**: Each module will have its own schema to separate data
- **Data Access**: Each module only directly accesses its own schema

### 5.2 Caching Strategy

- **Application Cache**: Redis for session caching and distributed caching
- **Content Caching**: CDN for static content
- **Query Caching**: Caching for common database queries

## 6. AI Services Integration

- **Query Optimization**: Optimized database queries and indexing

## 8. Security Architecture

### 8.1 Authentication & Authorization

- **Auth0 Integration**: Use Auth0 as the primary identity provider
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Support social login and enterprise SSO through Auth0
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Manage permissions through Auth0 Rules and Permissions

### 8.2 Data Protection

- **Encryption**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Input Validation**: Robust input validation
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse

## 9. Monitoring and Observability

## 11. Microservices Transition Roadmap

### Phase 1: Modular Monolith

- Build the system as a modular monolith
- Establish clear boundaries between modules
- Implement domain events for communication

### Phase 2: Shared Infrastructure

- Extract shared infrastructure into separate services
- Implement API Gateway
- Build service discovery mechanism

### Phase 3: Module Extraction

- Gradually extract modules into independent microservices
- Start with the least dependent modules
- Use strangler pattern for migration

### Phase 4: Full Microservices

- Complete transition to microservices
- Implement circuit breakers and resilience patterns
- Optimize service-to-service communication

## 12. Conclusion

The proposed Modular Monolith architecture for ReelNet provides a balance between initial development speed and future scalability. This design creates a solid foundation for rapid MVP development while maintaining a clear roadmap for transitioning to microservices as the project grows in scale and complexity.

The modules are clearly separated with well-defined bounded contexts, ensuring high modularity while maintaining the simplicity advantages of a monolith architecture in terms of deployment and operation.
